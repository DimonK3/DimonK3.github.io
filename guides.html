    <h1>Network Guide</h1>
    <p> Difficulty Level: BEGINNER </br>
        Objective of this guide: Acquire a foundational understanding of network fundamentals, including device types, IP addresses, subnets, and port functions within the Grey Hack game environment.
        Always refer to the manual if you encounter difficulties in comprehension.
        </br></br>
        In the game, networks operate similarly to real-life networks, but you don't need real-world experience to grasp the concepts outlined in this guide. Networks involve grouping devices and ensuring secure interactions with other computers. Each network typically has at least one router or one computer, with many including multiple routers, computers, and even CCTV cameras.
        </br></br>
        <p><b>Key Concepts:</b>
        </br>
        Networks rely on IP addresses, which can be LAN-IPs or Public-IPs. </br>
        Public-IPs are visible and interactable by every player, while LAN-IPs are restricted to within the network. </br>
        Routers connect the LAN with the outside world and create "subnets." </br>
        LAN-IPs are like room addresses inside your home, with Public-IPs representing your home address. </br>
        Switches are similar to routers but operate within subnets, acting like guards with firewalls. </br>
        Subnets are groups of devices, similar to different floors in a house. </br></p>

        <p><b>Device Functions:</b>
        </br>
        Routers create subnets and may have firewalls, can only execute non-visual programs like Terminal.exe. </br>
        Switches create subnets and may have firewalls. </br>
        Computers can run any .exe and do not have their own firewalls. </br>
        Cameras (CCTV) display video footage in the browser when connected to the right port. </br></br></p>
        <p><b>Additional Concepts: </b></br>
        Ports act as individual entrances to a network, with specific functions assigned to each (e.g., SSH, FTP). </br>
        Standard ports include: </br> 0 = ROUTER | 21 = FTP | 22 = SSH | 25 = SMTP | 80 = HTTP | 141 = BANK ACCOUNT / SQL | 1222 = RSHELL <br> 1542 = REPOSITORY 
        3306 / 3307 = DATABASE | 37777 = CCTV | 6667 = CHAT | 8080 = FIREWALL AND PORTFORWARD SETTINGS ON ROUTER</br>
        Ports can be open, closed or not forwarded, impacting exploitability. </br>
        Only open Ports can be exploited. Port 0 is always open, because its the routers port.
        Hub devices are used for grouping subnets or individual devices.</br></br>

            <li>.exe (executable file): Exclusive to computers; exceptions include FileExplorer.exe and Terminal.exe.</li> </br>
            <li>.bin (binary file "101010" Icon): Cant be opened. </li></br>
            <li>.bin (binary file "Gear" Icon): Cant be opened but executed, these are usually scripts (Compiled .src).</li></br>
        </ul>
        <p>You can check the icons in FileExplorer.exe</p>
        </br></br>
        <p stlye="font-size: 18px"><b>Understanding Important Files on Your System: </b></p>
        <p>
        /boot and /sys: Essential for system startup and operation. </br> </br>
        /etc: Houses three main files: </br>
        "passwd": Stores passwords, decipherable using the tool from the hackshop. </br>
        "xorg.conf" and "fstab": Critical for your home computer; deleting them leads to safe mode. </br> 
        /etc/apt: Contains "sources.txt," storing addresses from your apt-get commands. </br> </br>
        /lib: Holds all installed libraries, which can be exploited. Install safer libraries to prevent exploiting if possible. </br></br>
        /var: Contains "system.log", logs connections, disconnections, and file deletions. </br></br>
        /usr/bin: Stores all your default executables (Visual executables). </br></br>
        /bin: Contains commands; modify their source code (.src in the manual) for customized outputs. </br></br>
        /home: Contains user folders (If there are users on the system) and a "guest" folder; each user folder usually has a "Config" folder which contains Mail.txt and Bank.txt.</br></br>
        /root: Similar to /home/user but only for the root user.</br></br>
        /server: Exclusive to servers, contains config files for services like SSH.</br></br>
        /Public: Often found next to /server, contains the HTML file for the server's website.</br></br>

    <div class="div-actualGuide" id="exploitGuide">
        <h1>Exploiting Guide</h1>
        
        <p>Difficulty Level: BEGINNER </br>
        <p>Objective of this guide: This guide is designed to help you understand how Metaxploit and Metalib work and use that knowledge to create tools for accessing networks. 
            Throughout the guide, you'll find straightforward examples to illustrate how to effectively use Metasploit and Metalib for building reliable network access tools.
        </br></br>
        <b>Preface: </b></br>
        It is strongly advised to familiarize yourself with the scripting guide and networks guide before delving into this tutorial.</br>
        Replace every xVariable you encounter with the preferred variable name. </p>
        <p><b>Scripting the exploit: </b></br>
        To gain access to computers, routers, or switches, exploiting their vulnerabilities is essential. This is achieved through scripting, particularly using the Metaxploit and Metalib objects, as detailed in the Manual under Scripting.</br></br>
        There are distinct categories of libraries: local and remote. Local libraries, such as net.so, init.so, and kernel_module.so, can only be exploited locally,
         while remote libraries are exploitable from a different computer or network, keep in mind that remote libraries are always linked to a port. </br></br>
        To initiate the script, you need the metaxploit.so library. Achieve this by employing the following command: 
        <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">metaxploitVariable = include_lib("pathToLib")</span>, where "pathToLib" represents the path to your metaxploit.so library. </br></br>
        After this setup, assign variables to the IP address and respective port you wish to target. A common approach is to use <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">ipVariable = params[0]</span> 
        and <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">portVariable = params[1]</span>. Params are values post-command (e.g “exploit address port”). </br></br>
        The subsequent steps depend on the type of device you aim to attack. For devices beyond your LAN, employ the net_use method: <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">metaxploitVariable.net_use(ipVariable, portVariable).</span> </br></br>
        Now, the program needs to identify the library to scan. Define the library using <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">metaLibVariable = net_session.dump_lib.</span> </br></br>
        Proceed to scan the library with <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">listVariable = metaxploitVariable.scan(metaLibVariable)</span>. This generates a list containing various memory zones.  </br></br>
        Select the zone for investigation and execute the following: <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">print(metaxploitVariable.scan_address(metaLibVariable, memoryVariable))</span>. 
        This prints out exploitable memory zones with their respective dependencies.
        The final step involves exploiting these vulnerabilities using <span style="color: white; background-color: black;">resultVariable = metaLibVariable.overflow(memoryVariable.key, stringVariable)</span>.
        If successful it will return an object, indicating the success of your exploit. The object may represent a shell, file, computer object, or a number. 
        In the case of a number, it signifies either the firewall's disabling (if used on port 0) or a potential password change (if used on a different port). Remember to include a third parameter in the .overflow method for the new password.
        </p></br>
        <p><b>Abusing the results: </b></br>
            The different type of objects that get returned have different usages. They are as following: </br>
            Shell -> Connect to guest, non-root-user or root shell on target device.</br>
            Computer -> Read or write file.</br>
            File -> File can be a folder or actual file. If its a file, you can read the contents, for folders you can get the files in that folder.</br>
            Number -> Disable either firewall or change password.</br>
        </p>

        <p><b>Additional Information:</b></br>
            This guide covers a fundamental and straightforward approach to coding exploits. </br>
            While there are numerous ways to enhance functionality and aesthetics, these are intentionally omitted to maintain brevity and encourage players to explore and solve challenges independently.</p>
